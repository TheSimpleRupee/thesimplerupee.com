## **10X on Partner Brands**







  * **Validity:** 1st August to 31st December 2019
  * **Affiliated Brands:** Myntra, Swiggy, BookMyShow, PayZapp, Zoomcar, Godrej Nature’s Basket
  * **Maximum cap:** Diners Black – 25,000, Diners ClubMiles & Diners Premium – 5,000, Diners Rewardz – 2,000
  * Incremental 9X Rewards will be posted within **2 days** from the date of settlement of the transaction.






#### **PayZapp 10x confusion?**







  * All transaction performed on PayZapp will come under diners 10x limit. (Insurance / rent pay / bill pay)
  * Transactions redirected to Smartbuy will come under smart buy 10x limit. 
  * 10x points are applicable on payment via PayZapp wallet (e.g. BigBasket / Niki)
  * You won't get points on using any code on PayZapp. (I used BILLPAY and not received 10x points)
  * PayZapp Wallet load is not eligible for 10X Rewards.






## 10x on **SmartBuy**







  * **Validity:** 1st to 31st August 2019
  * **Maximum cap:** 15,000 in a month for Diners Black and 5,000 for Diners ClubMiles, Diners Premium and Diners Rewardz Credit Cards.
  * Reward points will be posted within 90 working days






PayZapp is a great addition, getting 10x for rent payment is awesome!
