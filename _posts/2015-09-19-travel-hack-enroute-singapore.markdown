I won’t say I am a globe trotter but just like other humans I love to have a vacation which fits into my budget and will not cost me  leg  an arm.In my adventure spree Singapore would be city of lights, adventure parks, man-made wonders, mind boggling architecture. A city which has each  and every system in place so that it becomes very easy even for a lame person like me to understand.This perfectly planned city has made 200% utilisation of the limited resources available to it.

## Some pointers:







  * Book tickets whenever offer comes generally July to august you will get lots of offer as Singapore’s independence day comes around that time.
  * Tickets from Chennai may cost you somewhere around 170 SGD to and fro per person.
  * Also you will get better currency conversion rates at Singapore airport  rather that Indian airport.
  * On the day you arrive get a SMRT card(cost would be 5SGD)This is an express card that would work on metros n buses for local travel.And don’t forget to add top up to this card
  * Save this map on your phone you will need it always.
  * Don’t forget to carry sport shoes or walking shoes.

### **Day 1:Garden by the bay, Singapore flyer , helix bridge ,Marina bay sands**

From little India go to SMRT station ,you can see for a train sign and that will take you to near by SMRT station.Most importantly follow map...catch correct line to travel to correct destination.Take train which will drop you at station Marina Bay.Best part about Singapore is the attraction is right above the stations.Visit the famous garden by Bay,entry in this garden is free.There are two domes rainforest dome and flower dome which are the main attractions.You have to buy a ticket for same. Dont forget to see FREE light and sound show at 7:15 and 8:15.From there go to mall ,there is a free water and light show at mall around 8:30 and 9:30.All the major and main attractions of Singapore lies in this area only, Singapore flyer, Museum, Marina Bay hotel.We walked down through helix bridge for Singapore flyer from garden by the bay.I must say the best view of all these places comes together in night…that is why for me Singapore is city of lights.Also visit Esplanade if you are lucky enough you can catch a free concert.  








### **Day 2: Universal Studio**

Take metro which will drop you  at harbour Front station.Don’t forget to buy tickets in advance that will save you from standing in queue and will save some bucks if you buy online.Take the broadway as it is free to walk from the SMRT station to sentosa Island.For the broadway you have to go via a mall just above SMRT.Enjoy the scenic beauty of sentosa as you walk down the broadway.Don’t forget to take maps from ticket counter.Walk down till universal studio until you reach the famous globe with Universal written over it.Welcome to the world of camera, action, lights, thrill, drama.Don’t forget to do the transformer ride, mummy ride and dinosaur attractions.I would suggest cover all the attractions as they take you on a X-D tour and then you could actually define adrenaline rush.One can skip some rides, but please don’t miss any attractions.Studio closes at 8 and opens at 10 so make sure you make the most of it.  
P.S. Never go to sentosa on weekends u will not cover everything.







### **Day 3: Sentosa Island**





![](https://thesimplerupeee.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/cb04c-seaaquarium.jpg)Sea Aquarium





There are 20 attractions like madam tussad ,wings of time,ropeway,sea aquarium etc.I would suggest buy a combined ticket for all these attractions that comes somewhere to be 79 SD.One can also buy individual tickets for any particular attraction they want to do separately also.You will get huge discounts if you buy tickets from agents located around little india or chinatown.Don’t forget to watch wings of time in the end.

If you enjoy wildlife as much as you enjoy nature this day will sum up Singapore for you.Visit Singapore zoo, jurong bird park .If you have kids they will enjoy but for a couple I felt its pretty boring.Then visit Bugis street…which I loved the most.Shopping time!!Shop for your dear ones without making it heavy on your husbands pocket.You get good variety of clothes,bags,souvenirs,chocolate,watches…so shop till you drop!!On your way back stop at china town,visit Chinese culture,Buddhist temple , enjoy heritage and also some local shopping.Next stop is Clarke quay enjoy the beautiful picturesque view, relax at bank, take a ferry which will take you to all the beautiful sights via ferry like Merlion ,Marina Bay,etc.Station for chinatown and Clarke quay are near to each other and fall on purple line.If you are a walk freak like we were then  walk down from Clarke quay to MerlionThe banks of river will guide you, Enroute from Clarke Quay via Boat Quay, Parliament, Asian Civilisations museum, Fullerton Hotel and then to the Merlion.
