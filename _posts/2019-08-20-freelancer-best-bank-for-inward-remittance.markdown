Have you ever thought why amount remitted in your bank is different than what your google search engine displays?  
Well, your answer is here!!   
For almost 3 years of my career, I never realized how much of my hard-earned money got wasted due to unawareness about which bank provides the best conversion rates.  
After a thorough analysis by opening multiple bank accounts, I realized public banks like IOB give you the best conversion rates.  
But one has to be prepared for a little hassle for every remittance.  
Private banks just need a mail to clear your inward remittance whereas government banks they like to be more social and would be glad to meet you in person. Very social of them!!
