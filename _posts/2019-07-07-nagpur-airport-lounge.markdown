I was looking for synoyms for lounge and "Sitting room" was the word that caught my attention.iN Green lounge in Nagpur is nothing more than a family sitting room.







First and for most to save you from little embarrassment below is a picture stating what cards may take you for a free spree.

It gives you limited food option so you don't get confused about your eating preference.







I checked in during dinner time and being a vegetarian that too a Jain I expected at-least some eggless desserts orÂ fruits .  
But to my great disappointment there was none.Soda and water (this option may amuze some)is all they have for beverage.

Even if you are a non vegetarian my dear friend don't expect much.Menu was pretty simple dal ,veg curry,non veg curry ,rice ,noodles,sweet and roti/paratha.  
The good thing about this lounge in terms of food is they serve hot parathas which are great to gulp the cold curries:P

Ambience as I said in beginning very homely,dim lights,peaceful and little cozy.In terms of people I guess it cannot accommodate more than 40 people in one sitting.  
No separate washroom facilitiy as good lounges will give you shower room with a more hygenic restroom experience.







Most Indian lounges have live kitchen option atleast dosa/omelette or some salad but here they have reserved it only for breakfast after all one should have breakfast like kings.  
  
So my overall experience I would rate will be a 4 out of 10(Sorry)







If you have free lounge access than you can give it a shot but if you are spending money I would rather say let it be safe in your pocket.







Staff was very humble ,and will serve you best with limited options they have.







Happy lounging!!
